# Practice Components

These projects are being developed as a result of a series of revisiting studies on simple vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Most of those simple components are part of [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) and [Florin Pop](https://github.com/florinpop17) udemy course [50 Projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/).

* Even though the projects ideas are not mine, I customized most of the projects in order to fill my studies necessities.
* Simple projects which are not from their course may be added into this repo.
* I may or may not use some libraries and frameworks like ReactJS and VueJS just for references, but this is a vanilla focused frontend practice repository.

Keep studiyng my dudes.
